# Computer_Graphics_Skeleton_Enviroment
The skeleton was created by reading a list of JSON files containing the positions of the spheres. The cylinders and the hat were created accordingly.  A simple environment consisting of a table, a chair, a plate and a glass was created around the skeleton. It is possible to rotate in all directions around the skeleton and zoom in and out.
